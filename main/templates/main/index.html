          He has helped me so much with my agility and strength. I really enjoy training 
          with him because he always keeps it interesting and fun. Overall I have so much 
          fun training and have seen so much improvement."

        <p class="testimonial-text">"I've been working out with JP For almost 4 years now 
          and my experience with him has been amazing. I love the way he pushes me to always 
          be better in everything I do. Over the years I've seen a big jump in overall performance 
          in my sport and my physical appearance. If I had to recommend a trainer to someone, I 
          would definitely recommend JP to any one of all ages and if they end up going, they will 
          definitely not regret it."

        <p class="testimonial-text">"I've been working with JP for a couple of months and it has made a 
          huge impact on my game. Not only my speed but my strength as well. JP is such an enjoyable and 
          fun person to work with."</p>

        <p class="testimonial-text">"Working with JP during my freshman and sophomore years at Moorpark College 
          was one of the best decisions I made for my athletic career. His strength and conditioning program pushed 
          me to become stronger, faster, and more confident, ultimately helping me transfer to Concordia University Irvine 
          to play Division II softball. Beyond being an incredible coach, JP is genuinely one of the kindest, most caring, 
          and most dedicated people I've ever met. He always believed in me, challenged me, and made me feel supported every 
          step of the way. I'd 100% recommend him to any athlete looking to take their performance to the next level!"</p>

          He's shaped me into a better player and I feel stronger in the sport I play. He has great workouts and

        <p class="testimonial-text">"Training with Coach JP has completely transformed my 
          preparation for the season. His program pushed me physically in all the right ways, 
          helping me build strength, stay healthy, and become more explosive on the field. 
          He focuses not just on working hard, but working smart, which has played a huge 
          role in preventing injuries and keeping me performing at my best. Beyond the workouts, 
          he's an incredible communicator who knows exactly how to guide you toward your goals 
          and bring out your full potential. Overall, he's a great coach who truly knows how 
          to elevate his athletes."</p>

        <p class="testimonial-text">“Coach Jp has been a great help from the start! 
          I am learning a lot in our sessions even after just 3 weeks of training. 
          I've had a very positive experience so far and can't wait to see what the 
          future holds” </p>

        <p class="testimonial-text">“Training with JP over the summer was 
          genuinely one of the best experiences I've had as an athlete. 
          He pushed me harder than I thought possible, and because of that, 
          transitioning back into my college workouts felt smooth and natural, 
          I came in more prepared and confident than ever. Beyond the physical 
          training, what stood out most was how much he truly cares about his 
          athletes. He pays attention, checks in, and makes you feel supported 
          on and off working out with him and that level of dedication is something 
          I'll always appreciate.” </p>

        <p class="testimonial-text">“Ever since I sarted with JP, I've noticed I've become stronger.
        He always pushes me to try my hardest and push past my comfort zone. JP is one of the few coaches I know 
        that makes conditioning fun. By the end of hour sessions I am left catching my breath, but always with a smile
        in my face. He is great with kids and at planning the perfect workout to meet his athletes needs/goals. Overall, 
        JP is a great coach and makes every second you spend with him fun!” </p>
