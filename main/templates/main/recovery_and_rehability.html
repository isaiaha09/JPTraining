        <h2>Myofascial Release (MFR): Definition and Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Myofascial Release (MFR) is a specialized manual therapy technique designed to relieve tension in the myofascial tissues, which include the fascia (a connective tissue network) and muscles. 
          It is aimed at reducing pain, restoring range of motion, and improving overall function.

        <h2>Benefits:</h2>
        <p>
          - Pain relief (chronic backpain, neck pain, or fibromyalgia). <br>
          - Improved flexibility and range of motion. <br>
          - Better posture and alignment. <br>
          - Enhanced recovery from injuries or surgeries. <br>

        <h2>Manual Therapy: Definition and Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Manual therapy encompasses a broader range of hands-on techniques aimed at assessing and treating musculoskeletal disorders. 
          The goal is to improve joint and soft tissue mobility, alleviate pain, and promote functional recovery.

        <h2>Components of Manual Therapy</h2>
        <p>
        <strong>  1. Joint Mobilization </strong> <br>
          - Involves rhythmic, low-velocity movements applied to joint structures to restore normal joint function. <br>
          - Used for conditions like osteoarthritis or joint stiffness. <br> <br>
         <strong> 2. Joint Manipulation </strong> <br>
          - High-velocity, low-amplitude thrusts applied to specific joints, often resulting in a “pop” or cavitation. <br>
          - Effective for spinal or joint dysfunctions with restricted mobility. <br> <br>
        <strong>  3. Soft Tissue Techniques </strong> <br>
          - Includes kneading, myofascial release, and other forms of massage to address muscle tightness and adhesions. <br>
          - Reduces inflammation and promotes circulation. <br> <br>
        <strong>  4. Neuromuscular Techniques </strong> <br>
          - Focuses on nerve and muscle interactions, targeting tension, trigger points, or neural tension. <br>
          - Examples include strain-counterstrain or positional release therapy. <br> <br>
        <strong>  5. Stretching and Mobilization </strong> <br>
          - Techniques like proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) to improve flexibility and muscle function.
